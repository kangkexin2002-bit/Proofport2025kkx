In this section, I have gathered many people’s “proofs of existence.” They take the form of objects, daily rituals, and subtle traces—each carrying emotions, stories, and personal interpretations of what it means to exist.
Some of these proofs are fragile and fleeting; others are solid and enduring. But all of them hold a private connection between each person and the world. They are not tied to labels granted by institutions, but instead arise from lived experiences and personal actions. Through them, we glimpse another kind of identity—one that is not defined by official documents, yet remains equally vivid and real.
