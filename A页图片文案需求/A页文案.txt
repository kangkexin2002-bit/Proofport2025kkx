I have a habit of collecting receipts—a whole bag filled with them, along with small, scattered keepsakes, like a private archive of my year studying abroad. This was my first time leaving home to live and study in a foreign country. When I first arrived in the UK, I thought, “I’ll keep every single receipt; I can’t bear to throw them away.” Now, as my time here comes to an end, I find myself thinking, “Maybe it’s okay to let them go. Maybe they don't mean anything to me anymore.”
Keeping these receipts has been my way of preserving a proof of existence. Printed on thermal paper, their ink slowly fades over time—just like my year in the UK, inevitably approaching its end. And like the student visa stamped in my passport by the Chinese government, my stay here is bound by a limit: one year, only as a “student.” No matter how hard I try to learn the rhythms of this place and blend into its life, I remain a temporary identity.
In this page, I use the validity period of my student visa as a countdown. As time passes, I have gradually built a stronger sense of self during this journey—no longer needing to rely on the receipts I once carefully kept to prove “my existence.” Here, the receipts fade and disappear as the countdown progresses, symbolizing both my farewell to them and my shift from relying on external validations to finding certainty within myself.
