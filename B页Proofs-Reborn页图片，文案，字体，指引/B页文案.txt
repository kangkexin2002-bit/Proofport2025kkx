The reason I made this shift in mindset is that I wanted to break free from the need for “proof.” Over the past year, my experiences have been real, the knowledge I’ve gained is real, and the changes and growth I’ve gone through are real—they don’t need to be defined by external rules. In this time, I’ve built a sense of self-recognition, and by tearing up these receipts, I declare that I no longer need them to prove “I once existed.”
Yet, I cannot deny that even with this inner acceptance, as someone holding a “student visa” and coming from another country, I still cannot fully belong here. My visa will expire, my rent will end, my studies will conclude. These “predetermined rules of the world” still bind me, and I will eventually have to leave. This is both a confrontation with the indifference of the system and a compromise I am forced to make.
